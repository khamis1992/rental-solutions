# System Architecture Documentation

## 1. System Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the system architecture, detailing all major modules and features. The system is built using React with TypeScript, leveraging the following key technologies:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

- **Icons**: Lucide React

The architecture follows a component-based approach with clear separation of concerns between UI components, business logic, and data access layers. The system is organized into several modules:

1. **Authentication & User Management**
2. **Customer Management**
3. **Vehicle Management**
4. **Agreement Management**
5. **Finance Management**
6. **Traffic Fines Management**
7. **Reporting System**
8. **Legal Module**
9. **Settings & Configuration**

## 22. API Contract Documentation

### 22.1 API Overview

The application uses a well-defined API contract system to ensure consistent communication between the frontend and backend. This section outlines the complete API contract specifications.

### 22.2 API Structure

#### 22.2.1 Request/Response Format

All API endpoints follow a consistent request and response format:

**Standard Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data specific to the endpoint
  }
}
```

**Standard Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {} // Optional additional information
  }
}
```

#### 22.2.2 Error Handling

The API uses consistent error codes across all endpoints:

| Error Code | Description | HTTP Status |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `authentication_required` | User is not authenticated | 401 |
| `insufficient_permissions` | User lacks required permissions | 403 |
| `resource_not_found` | Requested resource doesn't exist | 404 |
| `validation_error` | Input validation failed | 400 |

## 23. Advanced Architecture Components

This section provides detailed information about advanced architectural components that power the system's performance, maintainability, scalability, and accessibility.

### 23.1 Advanced Database Architecture

#### 23.1.1 Database Schema Design

Our database architecture follows a normalized design with strategic denormalization for performance optimization. Key design principles include:

- **Domain-Driven Tables**: Tables are organized by domain (vehicles, customers, agreements, etc.)
- **Junction Tables**: Used for many-to-many relationships with meaningful metadata
- **Inheritance Structure**: PostgreSQL table inheritance for hierarchical data models
- **Materialized Views**: Regularly refreshed for complex report generation and analytics
- **Comprehensive Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensuring data integrity across the system

#### 23.1.2 Row-Level Security (RLS)

The database implements Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to enforce access control at the database level:

- **User-Based Access**: Records are filtered based on user roles and permissions
- **Organization Isolation**: Multi-tenant data isolation for organization-specific data
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Custom policies for sensitive data (financial records, personal information)
- **Automatic Filtering**: Security policies applied automatically on all queries

#### 23.1.3 Performance Optimization

The database incorporates several performance optimization techniques:

- **Strategic Indexing**: B-tree, GIN, and BRIN indexes based on query patterns
- **Partitioning**: Table partitioning for large datasets (e.g., historical records)
- **Query Optimization**: Optimized queries with appropriate JOINs and subqueries
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management with pgBouncer
- **Caching Layer**: Application-level caching for frequently accessed data

#### 23.1.4 Database Change Management

The system employs a robust database change management strategy:

- **Migration Scripts**: Version-controlled migration scripts for schema changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring backward compatibility for existing applications
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing of migrations on staging environments
- **Rollback Plans**: Defined rollback procedures for failed migrations

### 23.2 Advanced State Management Patterns

Our application implements sophisticated state management patterns to handle complex application state:

#### 23.2.1 TanStack Query (React Query) Implementation

The primary state management solution leverages TanStack Query with the following patterns:

- **Query Keys Structure**: Hierarchical query keys for proper cache invalidation
- **Prefetching Strategy**: Strategic data prefetching for common user journeys
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with background synchronization
- **Infinite Queries**: Efficient pagination for large data sets
- **Parallel Queries**: Concurrent data fetching for dashboard components
- **Query Invalidation**: Targeted cache invalidation on data mutations

```typescript
// Example of structured query keys
const queryKeys = {
  customers: {
    all: ['customers'],
    lists: () => [...queryKeys.customers.all, 'list'],
    list: (filters: string) => [...queryKeys.customers.lists(), { filters }],
    details: () => [...queryKeys.customers.all, 'detail'],
    detail: (id: string) => [...queryKeys.customers.details(), id],
  },
  // Other domain entities follow the same pattern
};
```

#### 23.2.2 State Management Architecture

The application uses a layered state management approach:

- **Server State**: Remote data managed with TanStack Query
- **UI State**: Local component state with React's useState and useReducer
- **Form State**: Form handling with React Hook Form
- **Global UI State**: Context providers for theme, notifications, etc.
- **Transient State**: URL parameters for shareable state (filters, pagination)

#### 23.2.3 Performance Optimization

State management is optimized for performance through:

- **Memoization**: Strategic use of useMemo and useCallback
- **State Splitting**: Granular state to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Selective Updates**: Partial state updates to minimize render cycles
- **Debouncing/Throttling**: Rate limiting for frequent state changes

#### 23.2.4 State Persistence

The application persists critical state for improved user experience:

- **Local Storage**: Persisting user preferences and filters
- **URL Parameters**: Shareable filters and view states
- **IndexedDB**: Offline-capable data for critical workflows
