/**
 * Vite Environment Definitions
 * 
 * This file contains type definitions for the Vite environment. It ensures that TypeScript
 * properly recognizes Vite-specific environment variables and features.
 * 
 * The triple-slash directive below is a reference to Vite's client types, which allows TypeScript
 * to understand Vite-specific globals and environment variables like import.meta.env.
 * 
 * This is an important file for TypeScript integration with Vite and should not be modified
 * unless you're explicitly extending the Vite environment type definitions.
